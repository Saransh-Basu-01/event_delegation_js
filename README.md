Image Gallery Filter

This project is a simple image gallery that allows users to filter images based on categories using event delegation in JavaScript. The filtering functionality is implemented by clicking on the category tabs, which display only the relevant images while hiding others.

Features

Displays a list of categories in a navigation bar.

Filters images dynamically based on the selected category.

Uses event delegation for efficient event handling.

Implements smooth and simple CSS styling for better UI.

How It Works

The navigation bar contains multiple category options.

When a category is clicked, an event listener captures the event.

The filtering function (filterSearch) checks the clicked category and updates the display of images accordingly.

If 'all' is selected, all images are displayed.

Otherwise, only images matching the selected category are shown.
